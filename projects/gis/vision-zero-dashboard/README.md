# Vision Zero Dashboard

## Mapping the Path to Zero Traffic Fatalities

An interactive, data-driven web application analyzing traffic fatalities and safety interventions across the United States. Created for the AASHTO Savvy Mapper Award.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Vision Zero Dashboard provides comprehensive analysis of traffic safety trends, high-risk corridors, and successful Vision Zero interventions. Built with real data from NHTSA FARS and other public sources, this application helps transportation agencies identify where to invest in safety improvements to achieve zero traffic deaths.

### Key Statistics (2024)
- **39,345** traffic fatalities (3.8% decrease from 2023)
- **1.20** fatality rate per 100M VMT (lowest since 2019)
- **1,600+** communities funded for safety improvements

## ✨ Features

### 1. Interactive Fatality Heat Map
- State-by-state visualization of traffic fatalities
- Multiple metrics: total fatalities, fatality rate, pedestrian, cyclist
- Year-by-year comparison (2014-2024)
- Color-coded risk levels
- Detailed state-level popups

### 2. Data Visualizations
- **Trend Analysis**: 10-year national fatality trends
- **Contributing Factors**: Breakdown of crash causes
- **Vulnerable Road Users**: Pedestrian, cyclist, motorcyclist trends
- **Time of Day Analysis**: When crashes occur most frequently

### 3. Success Stories
